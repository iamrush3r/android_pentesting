## Android Application Penetration Testing - Basics
### Reverse Engineering
  1. Reversing Android Apps in very easy.
  2. If the source code is obfuscated, reading the decompiled code can be challenging.
  3. Many tools are available.
  4. Depending on what we want to do, we can use different techniques:
     - Read and understand app's logic : **dex2jar & JD_GUI**
     - Modify the app : **apktool**
- **APK Tool**
  1. A great tool for disassembling and patching android apps
  2. We will get smali code
  3. We can also get readable AndroidManifest.xml
  4. Requires JDK
     - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
  5. APK Tool installation instructions can be found at:
     - https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/
  6. **Test APK Tool**
       - ```apktool d SecureStore.apk```
       - This will create a folder with the APK name with all the files.
       - **smali** folder contains assembled code.
       - make all the required changes in the folder and patch it again using ```apktook b FolderName```
       - The patched APK will be available at ```FolderName/dist/```
- In Android 6 or higher, we need to ask for permissions at runtime.

- **dex2jar & JD-GUI**
  1. Great for viewing the source code from an APK file.
  2. **dex2jar**:

  3. **JD-GUI**:
